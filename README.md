# The Relativity of Classification

> Relativity of Classification is the collective name for a set of algorithmic tools, united in the goal to find novel
> and exciting ways of representing artefacts from the archive of the Institute of Social History
> in Amsterdam. In doing so, the project touches down on the problems of taxonomy and representation,
> and wishes to explore visually what constitutes an artefact's "thisness".

# Artefact
My chosen artefact is an aluminum Pin-Badge. More precisely, a selection of twenty badges, selected at random. Due to the visual similarity of the badges, I found them to be a perfect testing ground for challenging my explorations and researches on the topics of Haecceity, Thisness, etc (read more in the research section).

#### Disclaimer
For testing purposes, I selected one badge to be used as the central part of the transcoding process.

# Research
### What is a Badge?
In my research, I explore different ways in which a badge could be described...

### Thissness, Haecceity, Taxonomy, Classification, Typology
Thissness is defined as etc.<a href="#note1" id="note1ref"><sup>1</sup></a>

# Transcoding
Throughout the duration of this project, I went over several transcoding steps.

## Transcoding 1 - Capturing the Input
### Description
I attempted to capture the badge in various ways, to obtain diverse physical measurements.

### Methods

### Tools 
- Trnio
- Blender

### Results

## Transcoding 2 - A Badge as...
A badge may be described in numerous different ways - I decided to thoroughly explore some different genealogies and descriptive sequences that would arrive at the answer of: A Badge.

### Methods
I looked at the most suitable ways of describing the badge, and arrived at the following categorisations:

A badge is...
- the outcome of a production process
- something else
- 3rd thing
- 4th thing

### Tools 
This transcoding was achieved without self-made tools.

### Results
[Folder with various text-based descriptions]()

## Transcoding 3 - Disclose the badges by one main colour
### Description,
The artefacts are disclosed by their predominant colour. Analogous to tagging an object with one singular tag. Creates a highly simplistic, stereotyped interpretation of the artefact.

### Methods
Transcoding with Bash / Python.

### Tools 
- Tool 2

### Results

## Transcoding 4 - Semantic (Structuralist) Analysis of a Badge
### Description
JSON is a great environment for writing-out a thorough semantic analysis of the badge.

### Methods
JSON
Structuralist Syntax Analysis

### Tools 
- JavaScript

### Results

<p>
```javascript
code = codeHere
```
</p>
</details>

## Transcoding 5 - Disclosing the Artefact, one-step-at-a-time
### Description
A simple participatory app to describe a badge collectively, together, in steps. The idea is that each visitor draws according to the instructions given in the sentence prompt.

### Methods

### Tools 
-- participatory tool

### Results

## Transcoding 6 - Participatory Meaning-Making Workshop
### Description
The final transcoding will happen as part of a workshop. The prompt responses are incorporated into a final narrative about the fuziness of classification. 

After the user has drawn all the steps, she proceeds to a webpage "gallery" of all drawings from all visitors. Showing a beautiful subjectivity of interpretation.

The main points of the narrative concern:
  * Subjectivity of classification, categorisation
  * Reminder that we all hold extremely different interpretations of "Haecceity / Thisness" 
  * Reminder to beware of the reductionist, false objectivty of a given taxonomy
  * Reminder that it is important to have a precise, deterministic classification system

### Methods


### Tools 
-- participatory web application

### Results
  
## 🛠⚙️🗜Transcoding Tools

## Tool 1: IISG Image Scraper
### Description
This tool scrapes IISG's online archive of Badges and saves the image links, together with the link to the record, into a Python dictionary. 

### Aims
To automate the process and eliminate selection bias from my choice of artefacts.

### Methods
Dependencies used:
- Python
- Beautiful Soup

### Results
Sample of a data collection search.

### Source Links
Please include links to the tools, sources etc used during the coding. E.g. the resources used for making your coding tool.  

## Tool 2: Generate HEX Color Tile from Main Color in Image
### Description

### Aims
* The colour average is purely based on histogram - could improve with K-clustering for more natural outcomes.
* I am eventually developing a participatory web application, as a way to talk about the bigger narrative/story of the richness of classification.

### Methods
Dependencies used:
- Bash
- Python
- ImageMagick

### Results
PNG images.

## Tool 3: Draw by Instructions and Download your Drawing!
### Description

### Aims

### Methods

### Results

## Tool 4: Collaborative Drawing App
### Description
Continuing from the local version, this version is server-based and allows each visitor of the website to save their drawing to a directory on the server.

### Aims

## Tool 5: Narrative, featuring dataset of User-Made Drawings
### Description

### Aims
The final tool aims to bring together aspects of my personal research, a selection of artefacts, and the user-made drawings into a dynamic, evolving narrative page, that tells a story of the subjectivity of classification, and meaning-making.

# Reflection
My personal learning goals this semester were:
* Improve my JavaScript (et. al.) skills: Data Structures, File Manipulation, client-server communication...
* Improve my programming ability for creating small, interactive experiences... Websites as workshops, forums, spaces of participation...
* Write a poetic, didactic, accessible narrative dealing with the problems of classification / ordering
* Discuss the (my) Problem of Classification, my research-framework through this practical application, via a limited number of artefacts
* Develop a methodology for producing illustrated stories that are different with every user group
* Develop and tinker with playful transcoding tools along the way

# Outcomes
The final outcome of this semester is a collaborative web-application, which touches down on various aspects of classification and taxonomy through a participatory workshop.
