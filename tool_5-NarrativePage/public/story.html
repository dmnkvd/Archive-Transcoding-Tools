        <h1>A Subjective story of Classification</h1>
        <p>Some believe that the world is composed out of basic units. Perhaps all things derive from circles. The basic shape of unity.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>
        <p>As time progressed, so has the complexity of our perceptions, of our meaning-making…</p>

            <div></div>
            <div></div>

            <div></div>
            <div></div>
        </div>
        <p>We soon began to give things names, to differentiate them from one another.</p>
        <div class="image-grid">
            <div></div>
            <div></div>
            <div></div>
            <div></div>

        <p>By naming things in relation to one another, we were able to draw comparisons between them. What is it, that makes one thing, in essence, different from another? And what makes them similar? When can we begin to talk about Haecceity? Or typology? Taxonomy?</p>
        <p>We may order our artefacts into typologies based on the degree of similarity between them… Constant comparison, labelling, categorising, ordering… We may also classify them into a taxonomy, an archival structure, where they will be immobilised by a cryptogram of categories and classification codes.</p>
